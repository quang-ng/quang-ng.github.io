title: What’s New In Python 3.12
tags: [python]
---


Here is a summary of the key new features in Python 3.12 (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html):

## **PEP 695: Type Parameter Syntax**
This introduces a new, more compact and explicit way to create generic classes and functions using type parameter syntax, as well as a new `type` statement to declare type aliases.

Example:
```python
def max[T](args: Iterable[T]) -> T:
    ...

class list[T]:
    def __getitem__(self, index: int, /) -> T:
        ...

    def append(self, element: T) -> None:
        ...

type Point = tuple[float, float]
type Point[T] = tuple[T, T]
```

## **PEP 701: Syntactic Formalization of f-strings**
This formalizes f-strings in the Python grammar, which should result in faster tokenization of f-strings.

- Quote resue:
```python
songs = ['Take me back to Eden', 'Alkaline', 'Ascensionism']
f"This is the playlist: {", ".join(songs)}"
```

- Multi-line expressions and comments:
```python
>>> f"This is the playlist: {", ".join([
...     'Take me back to Eden',  # My, my, those eyes like fire
...     'Alkaline',              # Not acid nor alkaline
...     'Ascensionism'           # Take to the broken skies at last
... ])}"
'This is the playlist: Take me back to Eden, Alkaline, Ascensionism'
```


## **PEP 684: A Per-Interpreter GIL**
This introduces a unique Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) per interpreter, improving scalability on multi-core systems.

## **PEP 669: Low Impact Monitoring for CPython**
This adds low-impact monitoring capabilities to CPython, providing more insight into the runtime behavior of Python programs.

## **PEP 688: Making the Buffer Protocol Accessible in Python**
This makes the buffer protocol more accessible to Python programmers.

## **PEP 709: Comprehension Inlining**
This optimizes the implementation of list, set, and dictionary comprehensions.


## Improved error messages for NameError, ImportError, and SyntaxError exceptions
- Modules from the standard library are now potentially suggested as part of the error messages:

```python
sys.version_info
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'sys' is not defined. Did you forget to import 'sys'?
```

- Now if a NameError is raised in a method and the instance has an attribute that’s exactly equal to the name in the exception, the suggestion will include self.<NAME> instead of the closest match in the method scope. 

```python
class A:
   def __init__(self):
       self.blech = 1

   def foo(self):
       somethin = blech

A().foo()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    somethin = blech
               ^^^^^
NameError: name 'blech' is not defined. Did you mean: 'self.blech'?
```

More syntax error

```python
import a.y.z from b.y.z
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    import a.y.z from b.y.z
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Did you mean to use 'from ... import ...' instead?
```

### The release also includes many other improvements and changes across the standard library, optimizations, and deprecations/removals. Notable changes include:

- 
- Various performance improvements, including in asyncio and the tokenize module
- Removal of the distutils package (with Setuptools providing compatibility)
- Removal of several deprecated modules like asynchat, asyncore, and imp

Overall, Python 3.12 focuses on usability improvements, performance enhancements, and cleanup of deprecated APIs, with a particular emphasis on type hinting and generic programming features.
